<p>A simple offgrid solar system can be created using a Raspberry Pi (or equivalent), a standard 12v solar panel with MPPT and a battery. This system</p>

<p>A regular solar system includes a solar panel, a MPPT regulator, a battery, and some cables to connect all together.</p>

<p>In our system we have a cheaper full-size 12v panel of 100W bought from a big box store. This panel is oversized for running a Raspberry Pi above most of the year, but</p>

<p>Our first prototype uses a simple MPPT regulator with a USB output(https://www.victronenergy.com/solar-charge-controllers/bluesolar-pwm-charge-controller-lcd-usb#pd-nav-secondimage) where the raspberry Pi can be connected directly.
