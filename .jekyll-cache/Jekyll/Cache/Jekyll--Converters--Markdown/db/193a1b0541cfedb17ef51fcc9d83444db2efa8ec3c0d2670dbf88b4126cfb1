I"K<hem><b>Solar Internet</b> is an exploration of internet beyond an always-on energy intensive paradigm.</hem>
<p>Solar energy is used to explore how internet services can become more energy aware and efficient. Sometimes the sun is shining and there are resources for energy intensive data processing. Sometimes it may be cloudy and computer power is reduced. Sometimes the server may be even offline for some time.</p>
<p>This is an ongoing project and this website is still being filled with content and results. Explore the different <a href="/servers.html">servers</a> we have created exploring this ideas, from microservers using minute amounts of energy, to cluster computing adapting to solar production.
Learn more about how you can apply these solutions yourself in our <a href="/instructions.html">instructions</a>.
Or read more texts <a href="/discussion.html">discussing conflicts, problems and opportunities</a>.
